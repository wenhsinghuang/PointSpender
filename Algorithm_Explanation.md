## Algorithm Explanation  
1. Initial State:  
amount_to_spend = 100  
{  
("A", 100, "2020-10-01T10:00:00Z"),  
("B", 200, "2020-10-02T10:00:00Z"),  
("A", -200, "2020-10-3T10:00:00Z"),  
("c", 101, "2020-10-4T10:00:00Z"),  
("d", -100, "2020-10-5T10:00:00Z")  
}  

2. Get temporary transactions by dealing with history spend ("A", -200, "2020-10-3T10:00:00Z")  
{  
("A", 0, "2020-10-01T10:00:00Z"),  
("B", 100, "2020-10-02T10:00:00Z"),  
("A", 0, "2020-10-3T10:00:00Z"),  
("c", 101, "2020-10-4T10:00:00Z"),  
("d", -100, "2020-10-5T10:00:00Z")  
}  

3. Get temporary transactions by dealing with history spend ("d", -100, "2020-10-4T10:00:00Z")  
{  
("A", 0, "2020-10-01T10:00:00Z"),  
("B", 0, "2020-10-02T10:00:00Z"),  
("A", 0, "2020-10-3T10:00:00Z"),  
("c", 101, "2020-10-4T10:00:00Z"),  
("d", 0, "2020-10-5T10:00:00Z")  
}  

4. Spend "amount to spend"  
{  
("A", 0, "2020-10-01T10:00:00Z"),  
("B", 0, "2020-10-02T10:00:00Z"),  
("A", 0, "2020-10-3T10:00:00Z"),  
("c", 1, "2020-10-4T10:00:00Z"),  
("d", 0, "2020-10-5T10:00:00Z")  
}
